# tri-perfect
The search for more tri-perfect numbers!

Creating algorithms in javascript and Haskell to search for more tri-perfect numbers.

a perfect number is a number that when all its factors are added up, it is equal to 2 * that number.

i.e: 6

6 has a factor of 1,2,3 and 6.
1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12
12 / 2 = 6

A tri-perfect number is the same except the result is the inital number   mulitplied by 3.
